Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the development of high qulity software systems. Software engineering helps to play a crucial role through the creation of applications that enables the smooth running of processes for businesses. It has help in different aspect such as communication, construction, learning and development, healthcare and so on. With the advent of software engineering, processes have become easier and faster. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Miletones in the evolution of Software engineering: the rise of agile methodologies, development of programming language, advent of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software development Lifecycle: Requirement - it involves the collection and documentation of needs and system requirements, Design- this involves detailed and high level architecture nd user interface, Testing- this process involves checking the design to ensure it meets the quality and functional standards. Deployment- Releasing the software to users.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall has phases or project process. A step by step phase such as gathering information, the design and implementation while Agile Methodologies is flexible, multiple task or phases can be running at the same time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer:is reponsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures the the software undergoes a thorough and error free testing phase.
Project Manager: is responsible for overseeing the overall process of the project from planning, execution and delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments: it is a package that provides a detailed tool for writing, debugging and testing codes e.g visual studio
Version Control Systems: it is a tool for tracking changes to source code and giving the codes a structure.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirement
Technical debt
Tight deadlines

Strategies to overcome
use of agile methodologies, prioritization of task - having a daily to do list and quality communication.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: this is the process of test the individual components of the project.
Integration testing: this involves testing the interactions between different components
System testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance testing: testing against user requirements, if it meets the users needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the act of creating questions or statements to get the right and possible response from AI models. Prompt engineering helps to prevent confusing answer. This is achieved by providing a specific, clear and concise questions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
For example, vague prompt can be,  describe birds? as it is what type of bird and what family of birds are you referring to? 
But making it clear, you can have something like, Describe an eagle. the search is being specific and directed to eagle search only.
